      <h1>Display Heading</h1>
      <p class="text-lead">
        Until now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with
        Tailwind has been a tedious task that required a keen eye for typography
        and a lot of complex custom CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from
        paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful
        for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing
        user-agent styles, but when you <em>really are</em> just trying to style
        some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown
        file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        We get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly
        asking us things.
      </p>

      <p>
        We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our base
        styles is what you really want. You don't want to have to remove
        annoying margins every time you use a p element in a piece of your
        dashboard UI. And I doubt you really want your blog posts to use the
        user-agent styles either — you want them to look <em>awesome</em>, not
        awful.
      </p>
      <p>
        The plugin is our attempt to give you what you <em>actually</em> want,
        without any of the downsides of doing something stupid like disabling
        our base styles.
      </p>
      <p class="text-small">
        It adds a new class that you can slap on any block of vanilla HTML
        content and turn it into a beautiful, well-formatted document:
      </p>
      <p>

        includes,

      </p>

      <h2>What to expect from here on out</h2>
      <p>
        What follows from here is just a bunch of absolute nonsense I've written
        to dogfood the plugin itself. It includes every sensible typographic
        element I could think of, like <strong>bold text</strong>, unordered
        lists, ordered lists, code blocks, block quotes,
        <em>and even italics</em>.
      </p>
      <p>It's important to cover all of these use cases for a few reasons:</p>

      <p>Now we're going to try out another header style.</p>
      <h3>Typography should be easy</h3>
      <p>
        So that's a header for you — with any luck if we've done our job
        correctly that will look pretty reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>Something a wise person once told me about typography is:</p>
      <p>
        It's probably important that images look okay here by default as well:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556740758-90de374c12ad?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1000&amp;q=80"
          alt=""
        />
        <figcaption>
          Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
          has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making
          it over 2000 years old.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Now I'm going to show you an example of an unordered list to make sure
        that looks good, too:
      </p>

      <p>And that's the end of this section.</p>

      <h2>What if we stack headings?</h2>

      <h3>We should make sure that looks good, too.</h3>

      <p>
        Sometimes you have headings directly underneath each other. In those
        cases you often have to undo the top margin on the second heading
        because it usually looks better for the headings to be closer together
        than a paragraph followed by a heading should be.
      </p>

      <h3>When a heading comes after a paragraph …</h3>

      <p>
        When a heading comes after a paragraph, we need a bit more space, like I
        already mentioned above. Now let's see what a more complex list would
        look like.
      </p>

      <p>
        After this sort of list I usually have a closing statement or paragraph,
        because it kinda looks weird jumping right to a heading.
      </p>
      <h2>Code should look okay by default.</h2>
      <p>
        I think most people are going to use
        <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a> or
        <a href="https://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> or something if they want to
        style their code blocks but it wouldn't hurt to make them look
        <em>okay</em> out of the box, even with no syntax highlighting.
      </p>
      <p>Hopefully that looks good enough to you.</p>

      <h3>What about nested lists?</h3>

      <p>
        Nested lists basically always look bad which is why editors like Medium
        don't even let you do it, but I guess since some of you goofballs are
        going to do it we have to carry the burden of at least making it work.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most annoying thing about lists in Markdown is that
        <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements aren't given a child
        <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag unless there are multiple paragraphs in the
        list item. That means I have to worry about styling that annoying
        situation too.
      </p>

      <p>And finally a sentence to close off this section.</p>

      <h2>There are other elements we need to style</h2>
      <p>
        I almost forgot to mention links, like
        <a href="https://tailwindcss.com"
          >this link to the Tailwind CSS website</a
        >. We almost made them blue but that's so yesterday, so we went with
        dark gray, feels edgier.
      </p>
      <p>We even included table styles, check it out:</p>

      <h3>Sometimes I even use <code>code</code> in headings</h3>
      <p>
        Even though it's probably a bad idea, and historically I've had a hard
        time making it look good. This
        <em>"wrap the code blocks in backticks"</em> trick works pretty well
        though really.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing I've done in the past is put a code tag inside of a link,
        like if I wanted to tell you about the repository. I don't love that
        there is an underline below the backticks but it is absolutely not worth
        the madness it would require to avoid it.
      </p>

      <h4>We haven't used an <code>h4</code> yet</h4>
      <p>
        But now we have. Please don't use in your content, Medium only supports
        two heading levels for a reason, you animals. I honestly considered
        using a pseudo-element to scream at you if you use an.
      </p>

      <h4>Let's make sure we don't screw that up with elements, either.</h4>
      <p>
        Phew, with any luck we have styled the headings above this text and they
        look pretty good.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's add a closing paragraph here so things end with a decently sized
        block of text. I can't explain why I want things to end that way but I
        have to assume it's because I think things will look weird or unbalanced
        if there is a heading too close to the end of the document.
      </p>
      <p class="text-small">
        What I've written here is probably long enough, but adding this final
        sentence can't hurt.
